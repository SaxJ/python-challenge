# Challenge 7

* Page title is "smarty"
* What the heck is this image...
* Seems to be no text hidden in image...but there is an obvious grey band in the
  image
* Using Gimp, the blocks in the grey band have low RGB values, and each block
  seems 7px wide. The band is 45px from the top
* Using python-pillow, get the grey values.
* Now I have an array of ints...
* Ooo, converting to chars is definitely a sentence
* smart guy, you made it. the next level is [105, 110, 116, 101, 103, 114, 105, 116, 121]
* Woo!
