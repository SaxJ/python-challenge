# Solution
The hint given is "recognize the characters. maybe they are in the book,
but MAYBE they are in the page source.".

Looking at the page source, there is a comment with what looks like a bunch of
random stuff. (see mess.in).

The small python script I wrote counts the number of times each character
appears in the gibberish. You can see pretty easily that the word 'equality' is
in there. Putting that in the URL sends us to the next problem.
