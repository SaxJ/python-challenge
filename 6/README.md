This took me ages

* Page source has a comment saying "zip", so I changed .htm to .zip and got the
  channel.zip file
* Zip file contains a tonne of text files where you follow to the next text
  file, much like one of the previous challenges. At the end it says "collect
  the comments"
* I had no idea for aaaages, but searching zip file API in python, I see that
  files can have comments in a zip archive.
* This gives HOCKEY
* "It's in the air, look at the letters."
* The letters that make the letters in HOCKEY are OXYGEN. Hey!
