This one was a pickle. ;)

Took me ages to find that "peak hell" is like "pickle". Loading the banner.p
binary found in the pages source gave me a list of lists of (character, integer)
pairs.

I noticed the integers of each sublist summed to 95, so it must have some
structure. So I decided to print out each line, printing each character the
number of times specified in the pair.

This printed out "channel" which is the next puzzle.
